        - 12 pm to 1 pm
    - List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).

        - rpm - a Red Hat Package Manager file that's used to store installation packages on Linux operating systems

3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
    - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
        - The most amount of bytes is 13,204.5 on 2021-09-16
    - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?
        - There is something strange about this activity because only 2 people using that many bytes.

4. Filter the data by this event.
    - What is the timestamp for this event?
    - What kind of file was downloaded?
    - From what country did this activity originate?
    - What HTTP response codes were encountered by this visitor?

5. Switch to the Kibana Discover page to see more details about this activity.
    - What is the source IP address of this activity?
    - What are the geo coordinates of this activity?
    - What OS was the source machine running?
    - What is the full URL that was accessed?
    - From what website did the visitor's traffic originate?

6. Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights.
    - What do you think the user was doing?
    - Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?
    - Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity?
    - Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidlines?
